# Analysing Pet Product Sales

PetMind is a retailer of products for pets based in the United States. They sell products that are a mix of luxury items and everyday items. Luxury items include toys; everyday items include food.

The company wants to increase sales by focusing on products that are bought repeatedly, and has contacted me to analyse how repeat purchases impact sales.

See the `pet_supplies.ipynb` file in this repo for a step-by-step analysis.
